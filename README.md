# CBE
On this project the College wanted to redesign their home page to bring them in-line with a more modern look. Content was reworked to optimised for mobile devices. To simplify the future updates the CMS was utilised to extract data from lists. This data is then rendered on page.

## What was used
Design and development was done by me, SharePointâ€™s 2013 list features was used to store data and was then accessed using JavaScript.

## Who was invloved
Primarily contact was made with College marketing manager for specifications. Further consultation was made with another developer to ascertain the most efficient approach for delivering the project.

## Continued support
Project was setup to speed up delivery of site updates and simplification of managing of content. It was my responsibility to assist in training and updates of site as needed.
